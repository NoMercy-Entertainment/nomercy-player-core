## Pull requests

- Branch off `master`. Feature branches: `feat/<short-description>`. Fixes: `fix/<short-description>`.
- Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`). Imperative, lowercase subject, no trailing period.
- Tests required for new features. Bug fixes should include a regression test.
- Run `npm run lint:fix` before pushing. CI rejects lint failures.
- No `Co-Authored-By` trailers unless we paired live.

## Plugin contributions

Built-in plugins live in `src/plugins/`. New plugins are welcome — but most plugins belong in consumer packages, not the kit itself. The kit ships only plugins that are universal (event-bus, logger, retry-policy, etc.). Domain-specific plugins (Spotify scrobbler, custom DRM, etc.) belong in their own packages.

If you have a domain-specific plugin you'd like to host alongside the kit, open a discussion first.

## Releases

Releases are coordinated across the v2 trio (kit, video, music). Each pre-release publishes to npm under the `beta` dist-tag. The final `latest` release happens once consumer apps (nomercy-app-web, nomercy-cast-player) confirm a clean migration.
