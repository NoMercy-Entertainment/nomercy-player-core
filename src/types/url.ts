 *
 *  - `'media'`       — main playable URL (audio / video)
 *  - `'subtitle'`    — subtitle / caption URL
 *  - `'font'`        — font asset for libass
 *  - `'poster'`      — artwork / thumbnail
 *  - `'sprite'`      — sprite-VTT preview thumbnail strip
 *  - `'lyrics'`      — lyrics / LRC URL
 *  - `'cast'`        — URL handed to a Cast / AirPlay receiver
 *  - `'license'`     — DRM license URL
 *
 * Custom plugins may pass any string they like; the resolver should treat
 * unknown categories as a passthrough.

 *    Cast receiver / etc.
 *  - `raw` — the unparsed input as supplied by the caller.
 *  - `scheme`, `origin`, `pathname`, `search`, `hash` — standard URL components.
 *  - `searchParams` — query-string accessor (`searchParams.get('token')`).
 *  - `ext` — lowercase file extension stripped of query/fragment, no leading
 *    dot. Empty string when the URL has no extension. **Use this** to gate
 *    on file type — `.split('.').pop()` smears across query strings.
 *  - `relative` — `true` when the input was relative and no `baseUrl` was
 *    available to absolutize against. `href` will be the relative form.
 *  - `toString()` — returns `href`, so template strings work transparently.
